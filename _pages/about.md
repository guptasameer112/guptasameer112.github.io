I'm Sameer:
- 4th-year Computer Science student at IIIT-Delhi.
- Dabbles into research every now and then, currently working on a data science financial tournament project with [Dr. Gautam Shroff](https://iiitd.ac.in/gautam).
- Currently interning at [Maxim AI](https://www.getmaxim.ai/) as an AI Engineering Intern, helping bridge the gap between research and application.

Currently interesting in? Quantative Finance, Machine Learning, Business, Tech & Basketball (casually).

As a bonus aiming to build startups that are at the intersection of technology, AI and finance, and working with some of the best folks (still getting there). Currently helping build [Bizad](https://bizad.in) as a consultant and building XSeed, a trading system.  

Previously, I collaborated with [Dr. Sambuddho Chakraborty](https://iiitd.ac.in/sambuddho) on developing honeypots designed to detect, forecast, and mitigate dynamic virus signatures.

Alongside this, I worked with [Dr. Dhruv Kumar](https://iiitd.ac.in/dhruv) and MAX Healthcare on identifying different breast cancer subtypes as ER, PR, HER2 biomarkers using deep learning.

Bit too much?
