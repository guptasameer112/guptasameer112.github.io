I'm Sameer:
- A recent graduate in Computer Science from IIIT-Delhi.
- I dabble in research every now and then, and love brainstorming & building stuff.

I'm currently interested in Quantative Trading, Machine Learning, Business & Finance.

As a bonus aiming to build startups that are at the intersection of technology, AI and finance, go check out [BizAd](https://bizad.in).

Goal is to work with the best folks in the world in the fields of my interest (and get smart enough to gain entry).
