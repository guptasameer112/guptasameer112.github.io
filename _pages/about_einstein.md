I'm Sameer:
- 4th-year Computer Science student at IIIT-Delhi.
- Dabbles into research every now and then, currently working on a data science financial tournament project with [Dr. Gautam Shroff](https://iiitd.ac.in/gautam).

I'm currently interested in Quantative trading, Machine Learning, Business, Finance & Cybersecurity, along with building robust, reliable and scalable systems. 

How do we bring the beauty of algorithmic trading to the masses, while keeping it non-expensive and accessible?

As a bonus aiming to build startups that are at the intersection of technology, AI and finance, and can help improve the lives of people.

Previously, I collaborated with [Dr. Sambuddho Chakraborty](https://iiitd.ac.in/sambuddho) on developing honeypots designed to detect, forecast, and mitigate dynamic virus signatures.

Alongside this, I worked with [Dr. Dhruv Kumar](https://iiitd.ac.in/dhruv) and MAX Healthcare on identifying different breast cancer subtypes as ER, PR, HER2 biomarkers using deep learning.
