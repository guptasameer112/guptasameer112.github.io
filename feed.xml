It started as a daily journal, which never motivated me enough to write consistently. Now, it has transformed into a space where I document the highs and lows of my life. This approach doesn’t just keep me grounded, grateful, and humble, but it also brings immense joy and a sense of purpose to my everyday life.</p> <hr/> <p>“We, humans, keep jumping from one suffering to the next, in the world of samsara, suffering is eternal.”</p> <hr/> <h4 id="discovering-tushita-meditation-center">Discovering Tushita Meditation Center</h4> <p>Does it ever happen to you where you open your phone to look at something, and before you know it, you are watching cat videos and it’s 3 AM? My Google search one evening took a similar turn, starting from “Therapy Groups in Delhi” to “Meditation Centers in Delhi.” Among the many suggestions, one jewel stood out: Tushita, located in the posh heart of Delhi, Hauz Khas.</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/Tushita1-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/Tushita1-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/Tushita1-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/Tushita1.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <p>I impulsively texted my best friend about this place, eager to attend their next session. Despite the summer heat, the walk from the metro station was worth the effort. The entrance to Tushita, depicted in the photo at the top, welcomes you to a world cut off from the outside—no internet, no network, just people and meaningful conversations.</p> <p>During my first visit, the teacher, known as <em>Venerable</em>, not “Vulnerable” (a mix-up I made initially), greeted me with warmth and humor. Contrary to popular belief, the crowd at these centers isn’t just retirees; there are young professionals, businessmen, and even recent graduates.</p> <h4 id="a-session-to-remember">A Session to Remember</h4> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/Tushita3-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/Tushita3-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/Tushita3-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/Tushita3.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <p>The session began with a simple meditation to leave the day behind, followed by teachings that were both profound and personal. It’s an experience I choose not to fully document here because it’s something you truly have to experience firsthand.</p> <hr/> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/Tushita4-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/Tushita4-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/Tushita4-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/Tushita4.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <p><em>Caption: A group photo from one of our last sessions at Tushita. It was indeed a long day, but fulfilling.</em></p> <h4 id="reflections">Reflections</h4> <p>The experience at Tushita brought a calmness to me that is hard to describe. I’ve learned a great deal not only from the teacher but also from fellow attendees. There’s much more to share, but that will have to wait for another post. Stay tuned, and let me know if you’d ever like to join me for a session!</p> <p><em>Tushita is currently on a summer break and will resume sessions on August 15.</em></p> <p>Signing off for now, and remember—everyone has a story to tell.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Exploring"/><category term="Life"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Journey into Buddhism, meditation, and self-discovery at Tushita Meditation Center.]]></summary></entry></feed>
