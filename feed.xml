Each place holds a special story and a unique atmosphere that helps me stay grounded, grateful, and inspired.</p> <hr/> <p>“If it makes you happy, it does not have to make sense to the world.”</p> <hr/> <h3 id="libraries-more-than-just-books">Libraries: More Than Just Books</h3> <p><img src="../images/library0.jpg" alt="Inside a vibrant library"/></p> <p>Libraries have always been my go-to for focused study sessions. However, not all libraries are created equal. My journey took me through the good, the bad, and the ultimately perfect spots for hitting the books.</p> <h4 id="the-british-council-library">The British Council Library</h4> <p>This library stands out as a beacon of knowledge and comfort in Delhi. With its wide array of resources and a vibrant community of learners, it’s a place I frequently find myself returning to.</p> <p><img src="../images/library1.jpg" alt="British Council Library"/></p> <p>Here’s why it’s special:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Location:</strong> Nestled in one of Delhi’s poshest areas, it offers a tranquil escape from the city’s hustle.</li> <li><strong>Security:</strong> Tight security ensures a safe space for everyone.</li> <li><strong>Facilities:</strong> From a café on the ground floor to a relaxing area in the back, it’s designed for long hours of study and leisure.</li> <li><strong>Community:</strong> A diverse crowd of UPSC aspirants, students, and casual readers make up its vibrant atmosphere.</li> </ul> <p><img src="../images/library2.jpg" alt="Another view inside the library"/></p> <h3 id="college-library---a-personal-haven">College Library - A Personal Haven</h3> <p>My college library is another haven, segmented into areas designed for different needs: quiet study, group discussions, or casual reading with comfy bean bags.</p> <p><img src="../images/college0.jpg" alt="College library"/></p> <h3 id="cafes---unconventional-study-spots">Cafes - Unconventional Study Spots</h3> <h4 id="kunzum-café">Kunzum Café</h4> <p>Initially a travel café, Kunzum has evolved into a book café post-COVID. It’s a place where you can bring your own books or work, and enjoy the ambiance without the pressure to make a purchase.</p> <p><img src="../images/cafe0.jpg" alt="Kunzum Café"/></p> <p>Despite its distance and the transformation of its USP, it’s a great spot for occasional visits.</p> <hr/> <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Block A Starbucks in CP is a secret spot known for its spacious setting — perfect if you can resist the temptation of a pricey coffee.</p> <p><img src="../images/cafe1.jpg" alt="Inside Starbucks"/></p> <hr/> <p>I will share more about my explorations in future posts. For now, I’m planning to broaden my horizons beyond just libraries and cafes.</p> <p>Signing off until next time, and remember, everyone has a story to tell. Happy exploring!</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Exploring"/><category term="Life"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[A journey through my favorite places to study and unwind: from bustling libraries to serene cafes.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Exploring Buddhism</title><link href="https://guptasameer112.github.io/blog/2015/exploring-buddhism/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Exploring Buddhism"/><published>2015-03-15T16:40:16+00:00</published><updated>2015-03-15T16:40:16+00:00</updated><id>https://guptasameer112.github.io/blog/2015/exploring-buddhism</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://guptasameer112.github.io/blog/2015/exploring-buddhism/"><![CDATA[<h4 id="everyone-has-a-story-to-tell">Everyone has a story to tell.</h4> <p><img src="../images/Tushita0.jpg" alt="Entrance of Tushita Meditation Center" title="Entrance of Tushita Meditation Center"/></p> <h4 id="about-this-journey">About This Journey</h4> <p>I’ve always struggled with defining the unique selling point of this blog. It started as a daily journal, which never motivated me enough to write consistently. Now, it has transformed into a space where I document the highs and lows of my life. This approach doesn’t just keep me grounded, grateful, and humble, but it also brings immense joy and a sense of purpose to my everyday life.</p> <hr/> <p>“We, humans, keep jumping from one suffering to the next, in the world of samsara, suffering is eternal.”</p> <hr/> <h4 id="discovering-tushita-meditation-center">Discovering Tushita Meditation Center</h4> <p>Does it ever happen to you where you open your phone to look at something, and before you know it, you are watching cat videos and it’s 3 AM? My Google search one evening took a similar turn, starting from “Therapy Groups in Delhi” to “Meditation Centers in Delhi.” Among the many suggestions, one jewel stood out: Tushita, located in the posh heart of Delhi, Hauz Khas.</p> <p><img src="../images/Tushita1.jpg" alt="Inside Tushita Meditation Center"/></p> <p>I impulsively texted my best friend about this place, eager to attend their next session. Despite the summer heat, the walk from the metro station was worth the effort. The entrance to Tushita, depicted in the photo at the top, welcomes you to a world cut off from the outside—no internet, no network, just people and meaningful conversations.</p> <p>During my first visit, the teacher, known as <em>Venerable</em>, not “Vulnerable” (a mix-up I made initially), greeted me with warmth and humor. Contrary to popular belief, the crowd at these centers isn’t just retirees; there are young professionals, businessmen, and even recent graduates.</p> <h4 id="a-session-to-remember">A Session to Remember</h4> <p><img src="../images/Tushita3.jpg" alt="Meditation session at Tushita"/></p> <p>The session began with a simple meditation to leave the day behind, followed by teachings that were both profound and personal. It’s an experience I choose not to fully document here because it’s something you truly have to experience firsthand.</p> <hr/> <p><img src="../images/Tushita4.jpg" alt="Group photo at Tushita"/></p> <p><em>Caption: A group photo from one of our last sessions at Tushita. It was indeed a long day, but fulfilling.</em></p> <h4 id="reflections">Reflections</h4> <p>The experience at Tushita brought a calmness to me that is hard to describe. I’ve learned a great deal not only from the teacher but also from fellow attendees. There’s much more to share, but that will have to wait for another post. Stay tuned, and let me know if you’d ever like to join me for a session!</p> <p><em>Tushita is currently on a summer break and will resume sessions on August 15.</em></p> <p>Signing off for now, and remember—everyone has a story to tell.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Exploring"/><category term="Life"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Journey into Buddhism, meditation, and self-discovery at Tushita Meditation Center.]]></summary></entry></feed>
