**Project Overview**

*NerdLabs* is a comprehensive web application designed as the final project for the CSE202: Fundamentals of Database Management Systems course. This platform efficiently handles the management and interaction with an e-commerce database for a computer parts retail store. It provides a user-friendly interface for customers and admins alike, facilitating seamless operations such as browsing, purchasing, and managing products, while also handling tasks like user authentication and inventory management.

The application includes essential features that streamline both the customer shopping experience and the administrative management of products, sales, and inventory.

**Technologies Used**

The project is built using **Python** and the **Flask framework**, ensuring a lightweight yet scalable web application. The back-end leverages a robust **relational database schema** designed to efficiently store and manage information such as product details, customer data, and purchase history.

**Features and Functionalities**

- **User Authentication**: A secure login and registration system to manage user access, ensuring only authorized users can make purchases or manage the store.
  
- **Product Search and Filtering**: Users can search for products based on various criteria such as name, brand, or type, and apply filters like price or ratings for an enhanced browsing experience.

- **Shopping Cart Management**: Customers can add products to their cart, update quantities, and proceed to checkout with real-time updates on pricing and delivery times.

- **Inventory and Product Management**: Admins can manage product details, update inventory quantities, add new products, and remove outdated ones. They can also offer discounts and promotions on specific items.

- **Store Statistics and Reporting**: Admins can view detailed statistics such as revenue generation, product sales, and inventory status. Reports can be generated from SQL queries, OLAP queries, and transactions.

- **Transaction Handling**: The application efficiently handles database transactions, ensuring accurate processing of orders, updates to inventory, and customer order history.

These features work together to provide an intuitive and effective system for managing a retail storeâ€™s database, making it easier for both customers and administrators to interact with the platform.
