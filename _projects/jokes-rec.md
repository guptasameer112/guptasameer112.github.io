The project is developed using Python, utilizing libraries such as Pandas for data manipulation, NumPy for numerical computations, and Scikit-learn for implementing machine learning algorithms.

**Features and Functionalities**

- **Data Preprocessing**: The system processes and normalizes user ratings to ensure consistency and accuracy in the recommendation process.

- **Collaborative Filtering**: Employs collaborative filtering techniques to identify patterns in user preferences and suggest jokes that similar users have enjoyed.

- **Content-Based Filtering**: Utilizes content-based filtering methods to recommend jokes based on their features and the user's past preferences.

- **Hybrid Recommendation System**: Combines both collaborative and content-based filtering approaches to provide more accurate and diverse joke recommendations.

These features collectively enhance the user experience by delivering personalized and engaging joke suggestions.
