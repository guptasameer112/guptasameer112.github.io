**Project Overview**

FinSync is an enterprise-level financial data integration platform designed to aggregate and harmonize data from multiple financial sources. The system performs three core operations:

1. **Query Generation & Federation**: Generates SQL queries for various financial data sources, federates these queries across multiple microservices (PNL, Balance Sheet, Cash Flow), and manages data retrieval from distributed containers.

2. **Data Processing & Validation**: Validates and corrects company IDs against known valid entries, maps different schema formats to a standardized structure, handles both numeric and non-numeric data types, and performs data cleaning and normalization.

3. **Data Aggregation & Reporting**: Aggregates processed data to generate comprehensive financial reports, including Profit and Loss statements, Balance Sheets, and Cash Flow statements.

**Technologies Used**

The FinSync platform is developed using Python, leveraging the Django framework for robust web application development. This combination ensures a secure and scalable platform for users.

**Features and Functionalities**

- **Multi-Source Data Integration**: Connects to various financial data sources, including databases and APIs, to aggregate data seamlessly.

- **Automated Query Generation**: Automatically generates and executes SQL queries across multiple data sources to retrieve necessary financial data.

- **Data Validation and Normalization**: Ensures data integrity by validating company IDs and normalizing data formats for consistency.

- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Generates detailed financial reports, such as Profit and Loss statements, Balance Sheets, and Cash Flow statements, providing valuable insights into financial performance.

- **Scalable Architecture**: Built with a microservices architecture, allowing for scalability and efficient management of large datasets.

These features collectively enhance the efficiency and accuracy of financial data processing, benefiting enterprises by providing reliable and actionable financial insights.
