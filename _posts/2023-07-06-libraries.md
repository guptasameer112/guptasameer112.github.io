### Libraries: More Than Just Books

Libraries have always been my go-to for focused study sessions. However, not all libraries are created equal. My journey took me through the good, the bad, and the ultimately perfect spots for hitting the books.

#### The British Council Library

This library stands out as a beacon of knowledge and comfort in Delhi. With its wide array of resources and a vibrant community of learners, it's a place I frequently find myself returning to.

Here's why it's special:
- **Location:** Nestled in one of Delhi's poshest areas, it offers a tranquil escape from the city's hustle.
- **Security:** Tight security ensures a safe space for everyone.
- **Facilities:** From a café on the ground floor to a relaxing area in the back, it's designed for long hours of study and leisure.
- **Community:** A diverse crowd of UPSC aspirants, students, and casual readers make up its vibrant atmosphere.

### College Library - A Personal Haven

My college library is another haven, segmented into areas designed for different needs: quiet study, group discussions, or casual reading with comfy bean bags.

### Cafes - Unconventional Study Spots

#### Kunzum Café

Initially a travel café, Kunzum has evolved into a book café post-COVID. It’s a place where you can bring your own books or work, and enjoy the ambiance without the pressure to make a purchase.

Despite its distance and the transformation of its USP, it's a great spot for occasional visits.

**Pro Tip:** Block A Starbucks in CP is a secret spot known for its spacious setting — perfect if you can resist the temptation of a pricey coffee.
