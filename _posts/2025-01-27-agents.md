# Building Intelligent Agents: A Friendly Guide

Building intelligent agents is a fascinating adventure that mixes programming, artificial intelligence, and system design. Whether you’re just dipping your toes into AI or you’re already knee-deep in code, this guide will give you a clear roadmap for constructing agents, complete with practical tips and real-world examples. Let’s dive in!

## Understanding Agents

In the realm of artificial intelligence, an agent is like a self-sufficient digital creature. It perceives its environment (through sensors or data inputs) and takes action (through actuators or software commands) to reach specific goals. Agents can be as simple as automated email filters or as sophisticated as self-driving cars.

### Key Types of Agents
- **Reactive Agents**: Quick responders that react instantly to stimuli based on rules, without worrying about the past.
- **Deliberative Agents**: The chess players of AI, carrying an internal model of the world and using reasoning for intricate decision-making.
- **Learning Agents**: These improve with time, learning from mistakes, adapting to new challenges, and improving strategies through experience.

## Understanding Workflows: LLM Workflows vs. Agentic Workflows

In the development of AI systems, it's crucial to distinguish between different operational frameworks. Two primary approaches are **LLM Workflows** and **Agentic Workflows**.

### What Is a Workflow?

A workflow is a structured sequence of processes through which tasks are completed. In AI development, workflows define how models and tools interact to achieve specific objectives.

### LLM Workflows

**Definition**: LLM (Large Language Model) workflows involve orchestrating LLMs and tools through predefined code paths. 

**Characteristics**:

- **Predictability**: The sequence of operations is predetermined, ensuring consistent behavior.

- **Control**: Developers have explicit control over each step, specifying how the LLM processes data and utilizes tools.

- **Simplicity**: Suitable for well-defined tasks where the process can be clearly outlined in advance.

**Example**: A document translation system where text is processed through a series of predefined steps: language detection, translation using an LLM, and final formatting.

### Agentic Workflows

**Definition**: Agentic workflows are systems where LLMs dynamically direct their own processes and tool usage, maintaining control over how they accomplish tasks. 

**Characteristics**:

- **Autonomy**: The system makes real-time decisions about which tools to use and how to approach tasks based on the current context.

- **Flexibility**: Capable of handling complex, unpredictable tasks that require adaptive strategies.

- **Scalability**: Well-suited for applications needing model-driven decision-making at scale.

**Example**: An AI assistant that autonomously plans a travel itinerary, dynamically researching destinations, comparing options, and booking services based on user preferences.

### Key Differences

1. **Decision-Making**:
   - *LLM Workflows*: Follow predefined paths with decisions made by developers during design.
   - *Agentic Workflows*: Make decisions in real-time, adapting to new information and contexts.

2. **Flexibility**:
   - *LLM Workflows*: Best for tasks with clear, unchanging procedures.
   - *Agentic Workflows*: Ideal for tasks requiring adaptability and complex problem-solving.

3. **Complexity**:
   - *LLM Workflows*: Simpler to implement and manage due to their structured nature.
   - *Agentic Workflows*: More complex, requiring sophisticated mechanisms for dynamic decision-making.

## Building Blocks of an Agent
No matter how simple or complex, every agent has four main components:

1. **Perception**  
   How the agent gathers information—via physical sensors in a robot or data streams in software.

2. **Decision-Making**  
   The "brains" where rules, AI algorithms, or machine learning models guide the agent's actions.

3. **Action**  
   The component that executes decisions, such as robot limbs or software functions.

4. **Learning (Optional)**  
   Adds adaptability by allowing the agent to improve over time through machine learning.

## Steps to Build an Agent
1. **Define the Objective**  
   Be crystal clear about the agent's goal, like automating tasks or detecting anomalies.

2. **Understand the Environment**  
   Identify the environment, available data, possible actions, and constraints.

3. **Design the Architecture**  
   Choose between reactive, deliberative, or hybrid architectures depending on the complexity.

4. **Implement Perception**  
   Build the interfaces for data collection—API calls, sensors, etc.

5. **Develop Decision-Making Logic**  
   Implement rules, neural networks, or other AI models for action selection.

6. **Implement Actions**  
   Define how the agent will execute tasks, whether it’s clicking buttons or moving objects.

7. **Incorporate Learning (if needed)**  
   Add mechanisms like reinforcement learning to allow the agent to adapt and improve.

8. **Testing and Evaluation**  
   Test the agent in various scenarios to ensure robustness and readiness.

## Types of agent building workflows:

### The augmented workflow
"The basic building block of agentic systems is an LLM enhanced with augmentations such as retrieval, tools, and memory."
{% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/augmentedworkflow.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}

### Prompt Chaining
"Prompt chaining decomposes a task into a sequence of steps, where each LLM call processes the output of the previous one."
{% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/promptchaining.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}

### Routing
"Routing classifies an input and directs it to a specialized followup task. This workflow allows for separation of concerns, and building more specialized prompts."
{% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/routing.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}

### Parallelization
"LLMs can sometimes work simultaneously on a task and have their outputs aggregated programmatically."
{% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/parallelization.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}

### Orchestrator-workers
"A central LLM dynamically breaks down tasks, delegates them to worker LLMs, and synthesizes their results."
{% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/orchestratorworkers.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}

### Evaluator-optimizer
"One LLM call generates a response while another provides evaluation and feedback in a loop."

## Conclusion
Diving into the world of AI agents is equal parts excitement and challenge. By focusing on clear objectives, robust design, and thorough evaluation, you can build agents that reliably navigate their environments, learn from mistakes, and (hopefully) don’t turn rogue.

Happy coding, and may your agents always act in your best interest!
